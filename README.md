🤖 Modular Personality Bash Chatbot

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

A playful, multi-personality Bash chatbot with dynamic triggers, colorful responses, and fun modes — perfect for learning Bash, testing triggers, or just having a laugh.
Features

    Multiple personalities:
        Bash Tutor – 80’s valley girl style responses
        Hot Date – sassy, flirty responses
        Yoga Teacher – overly nice, calming responses
        Paul the Alien – scientific, quantum-inspired big words
    Ghost Mode: Slow typing with blue text for dramatic effect
    Dynamic triggers: Fetches personality triggers from GitHub so updates are automatic
    Funny fallback responses: When a user’s input is unusual or “bizarre”
    TinyURL integration: Long links automatically shortened
    Logging: All conversations stored in a single log file

    Trigger responses:

Triggers

    Stored in GitHub and automatically fetched by the bot:

        hotdate_triggers.txt – Hot Date
        yoga_triggers.txt – Yoga teacher
        paul_triggers.txt – Paul the Alien
